Welcome to this Data Structures Tutorial. Here, we will talk about three important data structures to know in Python:

- [Stacks](1-stacks.md)
- [Linked Lists](2-linked-lists.md)
- [Trees](3-trees.md)

Each section will contain descriptions, applications and examples, with a final problem for you to solve on your own. You should only look at the solution after you have attempted to solve the problem first. Please, reach out if you have any questions:
